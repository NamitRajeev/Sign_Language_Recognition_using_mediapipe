# Sign-Language-Recognition-system-

This project is a real-time static Sign Language alphabet recognition system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and TensorFlow. It classifies hand gestures corresponding to ISL alphabets and digits. 

  -A machine learning-based system that recognizes static sign language gestures using hand landmarks.
  -Focused on real-time recognition using only hand keypoint coordinates, extracted via MediaPipe Hands.
  -User creates their own dataset by capturing hand gestures and saving them as landmark coordinates in a .csv file.
